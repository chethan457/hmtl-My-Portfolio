    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Chethan — an aspiring
      <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> with a background in engineering
      and a passion for building impactful digital experiences. My journey into
      web development began with curiosity and quickly evolved into a
      disciplined pursuit of mastery across both frontend and backend
      technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve already built a full-fledged <strong>Amazon Clone</strong> using
      tools like <strong>React.js, Firebase, Stripe, and CSS</strong>, which
      taught me how to integrate real-world features like authentication,
      payment gateways, and responsive design. This project was a major
      milestone in my learning path and reflects my ability to bring complex
      ideas to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I’m deepening my skills in
      <strong
        >HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, databases, and
        deployment</strong
      >
      — everything needed to become job-ready and freelance-ready as a full
      stack developer. This website is my personal space to showcase my growth,
      projects, and the technologies I’ve mastered along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in learning by doing, and every project I build is a step toward
      becoming a confident, creative, and technically sound developer. Whether
      it's frontend finesse or backend logic, I’m committed to crafting clean,
      scalable, and user-friendly applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my work and join me on this
      exciting journey of code, creativity, and continuous growth.
    </p>
