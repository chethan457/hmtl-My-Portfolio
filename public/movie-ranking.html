    <h1>The Best Movies According to Chethan</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3><strong>KGF 2</strong></h3>
    <p>
      This is one of my favorite movies because I admire the confidence and courage of the main character. It shows that if you have the will to achieve something, you can make it happen.

    <h3>Max</h3>
    <p>
      A really cool movie. If you're into stylish action thrillers with a strong lead performance and minimal distractions, <strong>Max</strong> delivers maximum entertainment.
    </p>
    <h3>Avengers</h3>
    <p>
      The Avengers franchise is one of the most iconic and expansive sagas in cinematic history, blending superhero spectacle, emotional depth, and multiverse madness.
